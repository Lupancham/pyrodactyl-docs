## Panel Version Requirements

|Panel Version|Supported Elytra Versions|Php Version
|----|----|----|
|4.2.0|1.0.0|8.2, 8.3|



## Updating Your panel

### Update Dependencies
  Check your current versions by running
  ```bash
    php -v
    composer --version
  ```
  they should match at least the minimum version supported by the release your installing.

### Self Upgrade
  This is a feature in the works. It is planned for development and release at a soon point in the future.


## Manual Upgrade

### Enter Maintenance Mode
  Whenever you are performing an update you should be sure to place your Panel into maintenance mode.
  This will prevent users from encountering unexpected errors and ensure everything can be updated before
  users encounter potentially new features.

  ```bash
  cd /var/www/pyrodactyl

  php artisan down
  ```

### Download the Update

  The first step in the update process is to download the new panel files from GitHub.
  The command below will download the release archive for the most recent version of Pyrodactyl,
  save it in the current directory and will automatically unpack the archive into your current folder.

  ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | tar -xzv
  ```
  Once all of the files are downloaded we need to set the correct permissions on the cache and storage
  directories to avoid any webserver related errors.

  chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache

### Update Dependencies

  After you've downloaded all of the new files you will need to upgrade the core components of the panel.
  To do this, simply run the commands below and follow any prompts.

  ```bash
    composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
  ```

  You must also check for updated and new pnpm dependencies. This can be done by running
  ```bash
    pnpm i
  ```

### Build New frontend assets

  ```bash
    pnpm build
  ```

### Clear Compiled Template Cache

  You'll also want to clear the compiled template cache to ensure that new and modified templates show up correctly for users.
  ```bash
    php artisan view:clear
    php artisan config:clear
  ```

### Database Updates
  <Callout type='warn'>
    Only run with --seed if you want to load the new eggs shipped with this release.
  </Callout>

  ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed --force
  ```

### Set Permissions

  The last step is to set the proper owner of the files to be the user that runs your webserver.
  In most cases this is www-data but can vary from system to system â€” sometimes being nginx, caddy,
  apache, or even nobody.

  ```bash
  # If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS)
  chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pterodactyl/*

  # If using NGINX on CentOS
  chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pterodactyl/*

  # If using Apache on CentOS
  chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pterodactyl/*
  ```

### Restarting Queue Workers

  ```bash
    php artisan queue:restart
  ```

### Exit Maintenance Mode

  Now that everything has been updated you need to exit maintenance mode so that the Panel can resume accepting connections.
  ```bash
    php artisan up
  ```
